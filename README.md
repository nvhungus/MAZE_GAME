# MAZE_GAME: Tam and Gia Huy
Tam and Gia Huy is the title of our project, a Python-based game. This folder allows you to visually explore and reference the game.
We belong to group 11, class 23TNT1 at Ho Chi Minh City University of Sciences, specializing in Advanced Programming for Artificial Intelligence. Our team members are Nguyen Trong Hoa, Phan Huynh Chau Thinh, Tran Chi Nguyen, Kpuih Thuing, and Nguyen Viet Hung. 
We are delighted to share this with you.
Best regards.

# SUMMARY
For this game, you can create an account and log in to play, or you can also play in "GUEST" mode. We have an "OPTIONS" section where you can view game leaderboards, adjust sound, save and load games, and a "CREDITS" section with information from team members and trainers. There are instructions, a "HELP" section to guide players on how to play, and a "QUIT" section to exit the game. In the "PLAYER" section, we offer three levels of play, 2 game modes, and 3 algorithms to suggest paths. Additionally, you can customize the maze by choosing the positions of Tam and Gia Huy to play.
# ALGORITHMS
Depth-first search (DFS), A*, and Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms are utilized to assist players in navigating more efficiently through the use of the "SUGGEST" button, providing recommendations on the route. Players have the flexibility to select one of the aforementioned algorithms to determine the shortest path from Tam's current location to Gia Huy's position.
# EPILOGUE
This is a basic game developed by our team for educational purposes, so there are still some flaws in the operation and usage. We ask for your understanding and forgiveness for these shortcomings. Instead, please offer us your suggestions and advice so that we can enhance the game to its fullest potential. Once again, we express our gratitude to everyone and look forward to seeing you all in a future project that may be even better and more engaging!
